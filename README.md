# PigeonWorld

A procedural open world multiplayer game built with **Three.js**, **PeerPigeon** and **PigeonMatch**.

## Overview

PigeonWorld is a browser-based, peer-to-peer multiplayer **3D** open world game featuring:

- 🌍 **3D Procedural World** - Infinite terrain with height variation and biomes (water, grass, forest, mountains, etc.)
- 🎨 **Three.js Rendering** - WebGL-powered 3D graphics with lighting and shadows
- 🎮 **P2P Multiplayer** - Connect with other players through WebRTC mesh networking
- 🔗 **Decentralized** - No central game server required, powered by PeerPigeon
- 🎯 **Matchmaking** - Find and join other players using PigeonMatch
- ⚡ **Real-time Sync** - Player positions synchronized across the peer network

## Features

### 3D Graphics
- WebGL rendering via Three.js
- PerspectiveCamera with third-person view
- Dynamic lighting with shadows
- PBR materials (Physically Based Rendering)
- Sky dome with atmospheric fog

### World Generation
- Procedural 3D terrain using fractal noise algorithms
- Multiple biomes with height variation: Water, Sand, Grass, Forest, Mountain, Snow
- Chunk-based rendering for optimal performance
- 3D entities (trees as cones, rocks as boxes)
- Vertex-colored terrain meshes

### Multiplayer
- True peer-to-peer networking with PeerPigeon mesh
- Automatic peer discovery and connection management
- Player state synchronization in 3D space
- Support for up to 100 players per world instance

### Gameplay
- Explore an infinite procedural 3D world
- See other players in real-time as 3D avatars
- Smooth third-person camera following
- Terrain collision detection with height adaptation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- A modern web browser with WebRTC support

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PeerPigeon/PigeonWorld.git
cd PigeonWorld
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser to the URL shown (typically `http://localhost:5173`)

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

## Controls

- **W/A/S/D** or **Arrow Keys** - Move player
- **Space** - Jump/Interact (future feature)
- **E** - Gather resources (future feature)
- **Tab** - Show/Hide players (future feature)

## Architecture

### Components

1. **WorldGenerator** (`src/world/WorldGenerator.js`)
   - Generates procedural terrain using noise algorithms
   - Creates biomes and places entities
   - Manages chunk generation

2. **NetworkManager** (`src/network/NetworkManager.js`)
   - Handles PeerPigeon mesh network initialization
   - Manages PigeonMatch matchmaking
   - Synchronizes player state across peers

3. **GameEngine** (`src/game/GameEngine.js`)
   - Main game loop and rendering
   - Player movement and physics
   - Camera management
   - UI updates

### Technology Stack

- **Three.js** - 3D WebGL rendering engine
- **PeerPigeon** - WebRTC-based P2P mesh networking
- **PigeonMatch** - Matchmaking and collaboration engine
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server

## Network Architecture

PigeonWorld uses a decentralized architecture:

1. Players connect to a signaling server (`wss://pigeonhub.fly.dev`) for initial peer discovery
2. WebRTC connections are established directly between peers
3. PeerPigeon manages the mesh network topology
4. PigeonMatch handles matchmaking and session management
5. Player state is synchronized via gossip protocol

### Offline Mode

If network connection fails, the game continues in offline mode where you can still explore the procedural world.

## Development

```

### Adding Features

To add new features:

1. **New Game Mechanics** - Extend `GameEngine.js`
2. **World Features** - Modify `WorldGenerator.js`
3. **Network Events** - Add handlers in `NetworkManager.js`

### Testing Multiplayer

To test multiplayer locally:

1. Start the dev server
2. Open multiple browser windows/tabs
3. Each instance will connect as a separate peer
4. Players should see each other in the world

## Troubleshooting

### Network Connection Issues

- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure WebRTC is supported in your browser
- Try a different browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended)
- Check if firewall is blocking WebRTC connections

### Performance Issues

- Reduce view distance in `GameEngine.js`
- Clear chunk cache if memory usage is high
- Close unnecessary browser tabs

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Inventory system
- [ ] Resource gathering
- [ ] Building mechanics
- [ ] Chat system
- [ ] Minimap
- [ ] Day/night cycle
- [ ] Mob AI
- [ ] Crafting system
- [ ] Persistent world state
